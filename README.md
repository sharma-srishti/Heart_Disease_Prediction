# Heart_Disease_Prediction
Step 1 - Data Preprocessing: This involves cleaning and preprocessing the data. Interns will handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical variables.
Step 2 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): I have analyzed the dataset to understand the relationships between variables.I have employed various visualization techniques to identify patterns and correlations in the data.
Step 3 - Model Implementation: I have implemented all these models KNN, Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree to predict heart disease. And also understand the specific parameters of each model and how they can be adjusted to improve performance.
Step 4 - Model Evaluation: I have evaluated the model's performance on both training and testing data. Calculate appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC score.
Step 5 - Cross Validation and Overfitting Check: I check overfitting and if it exist then perform 10-fold cross validation. This involves dividing the dataset into 10 parts, training the model on 9 parts and testing it on the remaining part. This process is repeated 10 times with different testing parts each time.
